# WP-Hello World

## Description
This project is a plugin for websites that make use of the WordPress application.
When active, this plugin replaces all instances of the text "[HelloWorld]" (without quotes)
in web pages with the text "Hello World!" (also without quotes) styled in accordance with
the included CSS stylesheet. This is my first WordPress plugin and my goal in developing it
is to get more familiar with WordPress and to also have a reference project that can help me
with future development.

## Installation
To install the plugin, upload and extract the rdouglascanada-wp-hello-world.zip file to your
WordPress plugins directory.
